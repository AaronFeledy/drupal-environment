Provides a class for working with Drupal environments and environment variables.

## Basic Usage

### Getting an environment variable

```php
use Davereid\DrupalEnvironment\Environment;
$value = Environment::get('VARIABLE_NAME');
```

The advantages of using this is the results are statically cached.

### Testing for Drupal hosting or CI environments

```php
use Davereid\DrupalEnvironment\Environment;

$result = Environment::isPantheon();
$result = Environment::isAcquia();
$result = Environment::isTugboat();
$result = Environment::isCi();

```
